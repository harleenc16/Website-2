It includes both verbal and non-verbal exercises aiming to develop their communica- tion skill, particularly with spoken language. For verbal exercise, our app will be customizable by the therapists. In other words, they will be able to upload their own videos of pronouncing the words based on children\\u2019s needs. All the videos will be saved either locally. Once videos are successfully uploaded, children will have access to the video through the app to hear and see the pronunciation outside of the therapy session. When the children click on a video, it will be repeated ten times with volume decreasing logarithmically, and they will attempt to echo the therapist\\u2019s pronunciation while the video is playing. Based on a built-in speech recognition algorithm, children will get a certain score on the accuracy of their attempt. Once they pass a certain score, they can play games as a reward. While the SITA app was created for children with ASD, it can also be useful to other people with speech difficul- ties. We expect children who engaged with SITA will show greater language improvement on their language skills than children who did not have any external resources.\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 15,\n          columnNumber: 18\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 13,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 8,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Footer, {}, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 27,\n      columnNumber: 10\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 7,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n}\n_c = String;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"String\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/harleenchaudhary/Documents/Website-2/src/components/projects/String.js"],"names":["React","Footer","String"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAO,aAAP;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,WAAnB;;AAEA,eAAe,SAASC,MAAT,GAAkB;AAC7B,sBACI;AAAA,4BACA;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAf;AAAA,8BACK;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA,+BACI;AAAK,UAAA,GAAG,EAAC;AAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADL,eAKI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA,gCACI;AAAG,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,eAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBADJ,eAEK;AAAG,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,YAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gBAFL;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cALJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADA,eAoBC,QAAC,MAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YApBD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADJ;AAwBH;KAzBuBA,M","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\nimport './Style.css';\nimport Footer from '../Footer';\n\nexport default function String() {\n    return (\n        <div> \n        <div className='style-container'>\n             <div className='style-img'>\n                 <img src='/images/sita3.png' />\n            </div>\n\n            <div className='style-con'>\n                <p className='style-heading'>Summary</p>\n                 <p className='style-body'> SITA (Speech Indirect Therapy for Autism) is a useful resource to help children practice their communication skills under any circumstances.
